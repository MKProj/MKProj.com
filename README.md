# MKProj.com
The official website for MKProjects
This project is under the GPLv2 License 

MKProj.com has three distinct jobs, and each can be seen as a different page in the website. 

Firstly comes the homepage which automatically gets my feed from [dev.to](https://dev.to/mustafif), and 
generate the latest articles, and a total list of the articles. This is all done lazily to help cache the 
feed so it won't waste computing for no reason. 

Secondly comes the current projects, I was debating between using an ORM or JSON and I found JSON would keep the project a lot easier, 
and an ORM design wouldn't be too benificial for the added complexity. Keep in mind I only have 3 current projects, if it was more than 10, 
I'd use an ORM. 

Thirdly comes TexCreate Templates which is part of the newest plan for texcreate-v3, this section is to contain a list of all templates whether 
official or custom. When clicked, it would show info like author, license, a preview of the code, and a download button for the pdf. 

This project is still very much in production and will change very often as it is tightly integrated with the texcreate project now.
